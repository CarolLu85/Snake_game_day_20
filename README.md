i still havent had the mindset or logic that store datas in dictionary or list or tuple. 
like this task, at the beginning, to deal with the x and y coordinates, the fisrt thing came up my mind
was just set up two variables (x,y), and change x's value inside the loop.
instead of doing this, i could just figure out the exact x coordinates for all three squares, and save 
their coordinates into a tuple.
